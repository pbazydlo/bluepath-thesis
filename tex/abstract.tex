\dcsstrong{Bluepath -- library supporting creating distributed applications}

The aim of this work is to design a library, which, without complicated
configuration or installation of multiple components, will allow programmers
to implement distributed applications in easy way. A programmer, while
writing an application using a parallel programming model based on
threads, should be able to utilise the computing power of multiple
machines in a cluster. The threads created by the programmer instead
of being executed on one of machine's cores will be executed on one
of the remote machines.

At the time of writing there wasn't available any popular, actively
developed and commercially supported environment for creating distributed
applications in .NET Framework. This kind of enviroment would allow
programmers not only to avoid the need of solving many problems found
in distributed programming by themselves but also to save time. One
of the main goals was to make the library as modular as possible --
this way Bluepath wouldn't strongly depend on the implementation of
its components.
